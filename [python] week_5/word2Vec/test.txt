Because

However

to

the

A 
  
computer

based 
  
system 
  
that 
  
can 
  
detect 
  
bright

must 
  
therefore 
  
be 
  
capable 
  
of

Extending 
  
our 
  
previous 
  
work 
  
on

automated 
  
detection 
  
of

we 
  
have 

 
developed 
  
a 
  
machine 
  
learning 
  
algorithm 
  
that 
  
can 
  
detect 
  
bright 

 
lesions 
  
in 
  
retinal

photographs 
  
and 
  
can 
  
differentiate 
  
among

, 
  
and

The 
  
purpose 
  
of 
  
this 
  
study 
  
was 
  
to 
  
describe 
  
and 
  
evaluate 
  
this 

 
machine

¡V

cotton

spots 
  
in 
  
digital 
  
color 
  
fundus 
  
photographs 
  
and 

 
differentiate 
  
them 
  
from 
  
drusen 
. 
  
The 
  
evaluation 
  
was 
  
performed 
  
on 

 
a 
  
representative 
  
sample 
  
of 
  
images 
  
of 
  
patients

drawn 

 
from 
  
a

Netherlands 
, 
  
with 
  
100

images 
  
containing 
  
bright 
  
lesions 
  
and 
  
200 
  
images 
  
with 
  
no 

 
abnormalities 
. 
  
Because 
  
the 
  
purpose 
  
was 
  
to 
  
compare 
  
the 
  
machine 

 
learning 
  
algorithm

The 
  
machine 
  
learning 
  
algorithm 
  
is 
  
a 
  
so 
- 
called 
  
supervised 
  
algorithm 
, 

 
and 
  
therefore 
  
needs 
  
a 
  
set 
  
of 
  
annotated 
  
lesions 
  
to 
  
learn 
  
how 
  
to 
  
detect 

 
bright 
  
lesions 
  
and 
  
differentiate 
  
among 
  
them 
. 
  
For 
  
this 
  
purpose 
, 
  
130 

 
anonymous 
  
images 
  
originally 
  
read 
  
as 
  
containing 
  
bright 
  
lesions 
  
were 

 
selected 
. 
  
All 
  
pixels 
  
in 
  
all 
  
these 
  
images 
  
were 
  
segmented 
  
by 
  
retinal 

 
specialist 
  
A 
  
as 
  
to 
  
whether 
  
they 
  
were 
  
(

of 
) 
  
an 
  
exudate 
, 
  
cotton

, 
  
if 

 
present 
, 
  
were 
  
treated 
  
as 
  
background

. 
  
The 
  
images 
  
used 
  
to 
  
create 

 
the

Testing 
  
Performance 

 
Three 
  
hundred 
  
anonymous

were 
  
selected 
  
as 
  
the 
  
testing 
  
set 
. 
  
One 

 
hundred 
  
images 
  
were 
  
selected 
  
at 
  
random 
  
from 
  
all 
  
images 
  
that 
  
were 

 
originally 
  
read 
  
clinically 
  
as 
  
containing 
  
one 
  
or 
  
more 
  
bright 
  
lesions 
, 
  
and 
  
200 

 
images 
  
were 
  
selected 
  
from 
  
all 
  
images 
  
originally 
  
read 
  
as 
  
containing 
  
no

specialists 
  
( 
designated 
  
A 
, 
  
B 
, 
  
and

) 
  
performed 
  
annotation 

 
on 
  
all

in 
  
random 
  
order 
  
indicating 
  
whether

more 
  
exudates 
, 

 
cotton

or 
  
drusen 
  
or 
  
any 
  
combination 
  
thereof 
  
was 
  
present 
. 
  
A 

 
consensus 
  
annotation 
  
was 
  
then 
  
obtained 
, 
  
using 
  
a 
  
teleconference 
  
discussion 

 
format 
, 
  
by 
  
asking 
  
two 
  
of 
  
the 
  
retinal 
  
specialists 
  
( 
A 
, 
  
B 
) 
  
to 
  
reach 

 
consensus 
  
on 
  
all 
  
images 
  
where 
  
their 
  
independent 
  
annotations 
  
had 
  
differed 
. 

 
The 
  
consensus 
  
annotation 
  
was 
  
used 
  
as 
  
the 
  
reference 
  
standard 
, 
  
and 

 
contained 
  
105 
  
images 
  
with 
  
bright 
  
lesions 
  
and 
  
195 
  
without 
. 
  
In 
  
other 

 
words 
, 
  
some 
  
images 
  
originally 
  
thought 
  
to 
  
be 
  
without 
  
bright 
  
lesions 
  
did 

 
contain 
  
one 
  
or 
  
more 
  
bright 
  
lesions 
  
according 
  
to 
  
the 
  
consensus 
  
reference 

 
standard 
  
and 
  
vice 
  
versa 
. 
  
There 
  
were 
  
42 
  
images 
  
with 
  
exudates 
, 
  
30 
  
with 

 
cotton 
- 
wool

, 
  
and 
  
52 
  
with 
  
drusen 
  
in 
  
this 
  
test 
  
set 
. 
  
Some 
  
images 
  
also 

 
contained 
  
red 
  
lesions 
  
( 
microaneurysms 
, 
  
hemorrhages 
, 
  
microvascular 
  
abnormalities 
, 

 
or 
  
neovascularizations 
)

were 
  
performed 
:

Each

in 
  
a

these 
  
sensitivity 
â€“ 
specificity 
  
pairs 
  
can 
  
be 
  
used 
  
to 

 
create 
  
receiver 
  
operator 
  
characteristic 
  
( 
ROC 
) 
  
curves 
  
for 
  
all 
  
bright 

 
lesions 
, 
  
and 
  
for 
  
the 
  
differentiation 
  
of 
  
exudates 
, 
  
cotton 
- 
wool 
  
spots 
, 
  
and 

 
drusen 
. 
  
The 
  
ROC 
  
curve 
  
shows 
  
the 
  
sensitivity 
  
and 
  
specificity 
  
at 
  
various 

 
thresholds 
, 
  
and 
  
the 
  
system 
  
can 
  
be 
  
set 
  
for 
  
a 
  
specific 
  
sensitivity 
/ 
specificity 

 
by 
  
selecting 
  
the 
  
corresponding 
  
threshold 
. 
  
For 
  
a 
  
screening 
  
system 
, 

 
sensitivity 
  
is 
  
more 
  
important 
  
than 
  
specificity 
, 
  
so 
  
a 
  
threshold 
  
could 
  
be 

 
chosen 
  
that 
  
maximizes 
  
sensitivity 
  
while 
  
still 
  
maintaining 
  
enough 
  
specificity 
. 

 
Because 
  
human 
  
experts 
  
cannot 
  
( 
consciously 
) 
  
adjust 
  
their 
  
lesiondetection 

 
threshold 
, 
  
only 
  
a 
  
single 
  
sensitivity 
â€“ 
specificity 
  
pair 
  
was 
  
obtained 

 
for 
  
each 
  
human 
  
grader 
  
and 
  
plotted 
  
in 
  
the 
  
ROC 
  
curve 
  
as 
  
a 
  
point 

 
( 
Fig

) 
. 
  
The 
  
area 
  
under 
  
the 
  
ROC 
  
curve 
  
is 
  
regarded 
  
as 
  
the 
  
most 
  
accurate 

 
and 
  
comprehensive 
  
measure 
  
of 
  
system 
  
performance 
: 
  
an

of 
  
1.0 
  
has 

 
sensitivity 
  
 
  
specificity 
  
 
  
1 
  
and 
  
represents 
  
perfect 
  
detection 
, 
  
whereas 

 
an 
  
area 
  
of 
  
0.5 
  
is 
  
the 
  
performance 
  
of 
  
a

DISCUSSION 

 
Our 
  
results 
  
demonstrate 
  
that 
  
a 
  
machine 
  
learning 
  
algorithm 
, 
  
as 

 
described 
  
herein 
, 
  
is 
  
capable 
  
of 
  
detecting 
  
exudates 
, 
  
cottonwool 

 
spots 
, 
  
and 
  
drusen 
  
and 
  
differentiating 
  
among 
  
them 
  
on 

 
color 
  
images 
  
of 
  
the 
  
retina 
  
obtained 
  
in 
  
a 
  
community 
- 
based 

 
population 
  
of 
  
patients 
  
with 
  
diabetes 
. 
  
The 
  
area 
  
under 
  
the 
  
ROC 

 
curve 
  
of 
  
0.95 
  
shows 
  
that 
  
this 
  
proof 
- 
of 
- 
concept 
  
system 
  
has 

 
sensitivity 
  
and 
  
specificity 
  
approaching 
  
that 
  
of 
  
retinal 
  
experts 
. 

 
Differentiating 
  
among 
  
the 
  
three 
  
types 
  
of 
  
bright 
  
lesions 
  
from 

 
color 
  
photographs 
  
can 
  
be 
  
challenging 
, 
  
as 
  
illustrated 
  
by 
  
Figures 

 
3A 
â€“ 
D 
. 
  
The 
  
lesions 
  
in 
  
these 
  
images 
  
are 
  
subtle 
, 
  
and 
  
correct 

 
differentiation 
  
may 
  
be 
  
improved 
  
with 
  
knowledge 
  
of 
  
patient 

 
age 
, 
  
consideration 
  
of 
  
contextual 
  
lesions 
, 
  
and 
  
the 
  
size 
  
of 
  
lesion 

 
classes 
. 
  
Despite 
  
the 
  
complexity 
  
of 
  
this 
  
task

in

expected 
, 
  
drusen 
  
and 
  
exudates 
  
were 
  
easily 
  
confused 
  
because 

 
they 
  
are 
  
often

the

two

of

. 

 
The 
  
existing 
  
literature 
  
has 
  
focused 
  
almost 
  
exclusively 
  
on 

 
the 
  
automatic 
  
detection 
  
of 
  
exudates 
, 
  
only 
  
a 
  
single 
  
study 
  
included 

 
the 
  
detection 
  
of 
  
cotton 
- 
wool 
  
spots 
, 
  
and 
  
no 
  
studies 
  
took 

 
account 
  
of

in

Our 
  
results 
  
indicate 

 
that 
  
of 
  
all 
  
three 
  
bright 
  
lesion 
  
types 
, 
  
exudates 
  
present 
  
the 
  
easiest

detect 
  
for 
  
both 
  
automated

The 
  
capacity 
  
of 
  
our

to 
  
detect 
  
and 
  
differentiate 

 
all 
  
three 
  
types 
  
of 
  
lesions 
  
distinguishes 
  
it 
  
from 
  
prior 
  
studies 
. 

 
Despite 
  
the 
  
encouraging 
  
performance 
  
achieved 
  
by 
  
the 

 
present 
  
system 
, 
  
several 
  
major 
  
issues 
  
remain 
. 
  
One 
  
disadvantage 

 
of 
  
this

is 
  
its 
  
simple

To

the 
  
probability 
  
for 
  
all 
  
pixels 
  
in 
  
an 
  
image 
  
( 
in 
  
the

set 
) 

 
to 
  
be 
  
part 
  
of 
  
a

is 
  
convolved 
  
with 
  
a 
  
set 
  
of 
  
14 
  
digital 
  
filters 
. 
  
These 
  
filters 
  
are 

 
based 
  
on 
  
Gaussian 
  
derivatives 
  
and 
  
are 
  
invariant 
  
to 
  
rotation 
  
and 
  
translation 

 
of 
  
the 
  
image 
. 
  
The 
  
specific 
  
image 
  
filters 
  
used 
  
were 
  
selected 

 
from 
  
a 
  
larger 
  
set 
  
of 
  
second

order 
  
irreducible 
  
invariants 
,

by 
  
using 
  
the 

 
training 
  
images 
  
and 
  
a

algorithm 
. 
  
If 
  
a 
  
bright

is 

 
present 
, 
  
the 
  
combination 
  
of 
  
filter 
  
responses 
  
for 
  
pixels 
  
in 
  
or 
  
close 
  
to 

 
that 
  
bright

will 
  
be 
  
different 
  
from 
  
the 
  
filter 
  
responses 
  
for 

 
nonlesion

. 
  
The 
  
classifier 
  
used 
  
to 
  
classify 
  
the 
  
pixels 
  
on 
  
the 
  
basis 

 
of 
  
the

) 
  
classifier 
.

Such 
  
a 
  
classifier 
  
is 
  
capable 
  
of 
  
assigning 
  
probabilities 
  
to 
  
pixels 
  
in 
  
an 

 
image 
  
based 
  
on 
  
the 
  
combination 
  
of 
  
filter 
  
responses 
  
and 
  
can 
  
generate 

 
a

( 
example 
: 
  
second

) 
  
that 
  
indicates 

 
the

that 
  
each 
  
pixel 
  
is 
  
part 
  
of 
  
a 
  
bright

. 
  
The 

 
kNN 
  
classifier 
  
is 
  
a 
  
machine 
  
learning 
  
algorithm 
  
and 
  
is 
  
trained 
  
by 

 
offering 
  
it 
  
a 
  
set 
  
of 
  
training 
  
pixels 
  
from 
  
the 
  
training

where 

 
the 
  
classification 
  
has

The

, 
  
most 

 
of 
  
which

and 
  
some 
  
of 
  
which 
  
are 

 
from 
  
posterior 
  
hyaloid 
  
reflexes 
. 
  
A 
  
second 
  
kNN 
  
classifier 
  
was 

 
trained 
  
by 
  
using 
  
a

potential 
  
lesions 
  
extracted 
  
from 

 
the

to 
  
suppress 
  
spurious 
  
bright 
  
lesion 
  
clusters 
  
(

for 
  
the 
  
features

) 
. 
  
The

the

multiple 
  
image 
  
RGB

its

vessel 
; 

 
and 
  
proximity

the

lesion 
  
are 
  
more

to 
  
be 
  
true 
  
bright 
  
lesions 
. 
  
Each 

 
potential 
  
lesion 
  
is 
  
thereby 
  
assigned 
  
a 
  
probability 
  
indicating 
  
the

it 
  
is 
  
a
